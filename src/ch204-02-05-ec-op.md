# EC OP Builtin

The _EC OP_ (Elliptic Curve OPeration) builtin performs elliptic curve operations on the STARK curve. Specifically, it computes R = P + mQ, where P and Q are points on the curve and m is a scalar multiplier. Each point (P, Q and R) is represented by a pair of field elements for its x and y coordinates.

This builtin enables efficient implementation of cryptographic algorithms that require elliptic curve arithmetic, providing significant performance advantages over implementing these operations directly in Cairo code.

## Cells Organization

The EC OP builtin has its own dedicated segment during a Cairo VM run. Each operation is represented by a block of 7 cells:

| Offset | Description    | Role   |
| ------ | -------------- | ------ |
| 0      | P.x coordinate | Input  |
| 1      | P.y coordinate | Input  |
| 2      | Q.x coordinate | Input  |
| 3      | Q.y coordinate | Input  |
| 4      | m scalar value | Input  |
| 5      | R.x coordinate | Output |
| 6      | R.y coordinate | Output |

The first five cells are inputs that must be written by the program, while the last two cells are outputs that will be computed by the VM when read.

### Valid Operation Example

In this example, we can see a correctly configured EC OP builtin operation:

<div align="center">
  <img src="ecop-segment.png" alt="EC OP builtin segment" width="450px"/>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <span class="caption">Snapshot 1 - Valid EC OP segment with complete input values</span>
</div>

The program has properly set:

- Point P coordinates
- Point Q coordinates
- Scalar m value

When the program reads cells at offsets 5 and 6, the VM computes R = P + mQ and returns the result coordinates.

### Error Condition Example

In this example, we see an error condition when trying to read the result with incomplete inputs:

<div align="center">
  <img src="ecop-invalid-inputs.png" alt="Incomplete input values in EC OP builtin segment" width="450px"/>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <span class="caption">Snapshot 2 - Error due to incomplete input values</span>
</div>

The program attempts to read the output cells at offsets 5 and 6, but the VM cannot compute R = P + mQ because:

- Point P coordinates are properly set
- Point Q coordinates are missing (both cells are empty)
- Scalar m value is set

Since the coordinates of point Q are missing, the VM cannot perform the calculation and will throw an error when attempting to read the output cells.

If any input value is invalid (not a field element) or missing, the EC OP builtin will fail when its output is accessed. All five input cells must contain valid field elements before reading the output.
